(1,'The nine single-digit numbers are the foundation of the study of Numerology and the essence of order in our world. Each of the numbers has its own symbolism and meaning -- almost like its own personality -- and its presence influences our lives in different ways. Understanding the unique meaning of these numbers helps us receive the important messages they are sending when they appear in our Numerology and throughout our lives. The number 1 -- the very first of all numbers -- puts power directly in our hands as a symbol of independence, confidence, and new beginnings.',
'There\'s so much motivation and momentum surrounding this single-digit number. It is a true pioneer, eager to break ground on new endeavors and pave the way for others to follow. It is a natural leader and a proactive force. The number 1 represents newness, movement, and the possibilities that await us. In spiritual symbolism, it is the number of creation and the birth of all things -- the divine origin of the universe. In Numerology the number 1 is the root of opportunity in our lives. It is a symbol of confidence, power, and action. It pushes us to look at our current circumstances and realize that we have the power to turn them into anything we wish. Even if we are afraid, the 1 inspires us to take control of our future and embrace new beginnings.',
'People born with a Life Path number 1 are on a lifelong mission to exert their independence and step into their personal power. They carry a natural air of authority as a leader who likes to be the first to try something new. A strong desire for manifestation keeps them moving and improving.
People with a Numerology Life Path 1 are born to act quickly and have no problem changing course and starting down a new path. A secret fear of failure makes them ultra-driven in every endeavor they pursue and will often make them victorious. As soon as one finish line is reached, they are already running toward another.
A feeling of isolation may follow people with this Life Path, but it\'s also what helps them make progress. Cooperating with other people in romantic relationships or teamwork settings can be difficult for number 1 people, who prefer to go their own way. They don\'t identify much with others\' pursuits and only feel free when they are unattached. A thriving love life is not usually one of their goals. The Life Path 1 in Numerology likes to move quickly and this can come across as impatience or short-sightedness to others. However, it\'s this trait that makes people with a 1 Life Path number the early birds who are the first to take advantage new opportunities and the first to reap the rewards. While other people are weighing their options and making long-term plans, those with a Life Path 1 are already in motion, confident they can make things up as they go along.',
'Independent: Of all the numbers in Numerology, the 1 is the most self-sufficient, needing nothing but itself and its energy to thrive. It doesn\'t sit around waiting for opportunities to come about, it makes its own luck by capitalizing on circumstances others may be afraid to explore. The single-digit number 1 doesn\'t want to waste any time getting stuck negotiating or discussing plans. Going it alone allows for greater flexibility and quick, efficient movement. Goal-oriented: With a positive outlook and unwavering self-determination, this number excels at setting and going after its goals. It has a hard time standing still because it sees a world packed with possibilities just waiting to be taken advantage of. It\'s not that the number 1 can\'t be satisfied, rather, its satisfaction comes from staying active and always progressing. In a few words: Why stand still when you could advance?
Innovative: Roadblocks don\'t exist for the strong-willed 1 -- not because they don\'t arise, but because this number\'s innovative mindset can find new ideas and creative solutions to work around them. Instead of being daunted by obstacles, the 1 looks at them as a challenge that must be (and will be) overcome. Seeing a door where others see a wall is a major asset to the 1\'s success.',
'Forceful: While this number can come across as ambitious, its stop-at-nothing attitude can also make it seem uncaring or domineering as it pushes its way forward. More physical than spiritual, it doesn\'t need anyone else\'s help and is too focused on its own pursuits to even realize when it\'s made an offense. Softer energies of cooperation and patience get shoved aside in the interest of movement and progress.
Risky: The number 1 would call itself fearless, but a lack of foresight can all-too-easily lead it into trouble that could have been avoided. Tunnel vision and an extreme sense of invincibility makes the 1 so focused on the path before it that it can miss the warning signs in its peripheral vision.
Doubtful: With such an extreme drive to accomplish and succeed, self-doubt is this number\'s Achilles heel. Though it won\'t show it on the outside, the number 1 harbors a deep fear of making mistakes or coming up short of its goal. It takes even minor criticism to heart but will ultimately use it as motivation to improve.',

(2,'Between the numbers 1-9 there is a full spectrum of energies represented. Each of these single-digit numbers has its own meaning and personality traits that give us clues as to how the number affects our lives. There are many numbers influencing us in our own Numerology charts. In fact, when you start to look around, you\'ll notice these symbols are everywhere, and understanding their meaning helps you understand their message. Here\'s what you need to know about the Numerology number 2...',
'The Numerology number 2 is known to numerologists as a supremely feminine force, one that represents both grace and power. It is cooperative, always aiming to bring peace and balance back to a relationship or situation. This Numerology number is also very sensitive -- of all the numbers, it has the strongest intuition. It is able to sense currents and feelings instinctively, then use these clues to connect with others empathically.
At its very core the 2 in Numerology represents partnerships -- the coming together or balancing of two individual people, concepts, or things. While it holds great power over any situation, it wields it with such diplomacy and tact that the result is not control and authority, but harmony and teamwork. It is a mediator, able to see two sides of a situation in an unbiased way and guide others down the middle road.',
'People that were born with a 2 Life Path are blessed with beautiful hearts that they use to bring beautiful relationships into their lives.
From romantic and business partnerships to family and friendships, these bonds are the most valuable thing in life to a person with a Life Path 2. They thrive in being part of a team and will do everything in their power to make it a happy, easy, and successful union. They are incredibly giving and do well at creating long-lasting connections with others.
Every action and decision of a person with a Life Path number 2 is geared at creating a harmonious existence. From the professional path they choose to who they surround themselves with to their spiritual pursuits, it\'s all driven by a desire for peace. To this end, however, 2 people can be so passive that they miss out on their full potential. Whether this means staying silent about things that upset them or not asking for a raise or promotion to avoid rocking the boat, people with this Life Path can suffer from never putting their needs first.
The subconscious mind is extremely powerful for a person born with a 2 Life Path. They may often just \"know\" things about people they meet or be able to sense the undercurrent of a situation before it reveals itself. This level of intuition allows people with a number Life Path number 2 to get in front of problems and address them before they start to throw things off balance. In relationships, the ability to sense what another person is thinking or feeling gives these people an understanding, compassionate quality that makes others feel nurtured.',
'Intuitive: On a very deep and subconscious level, this number can pick up on energies that cannot be seen, only felt. This trait allows the number 2 to be instinctually aware of feelings, thoughts, hopes, and fears others haven\'t even expressed, then use them as opportunities to offer support and compassion to the partnership.
Unifying: The 2 in Numerology is a peacemaker that is keenly aware of the values of cooperation and working together. It is diplomatic in its dealings, because to be anything else would create imbalance. Even when up against contrasting energies, this number sees how the differences can join together to create something complete and well-rounded.
Influential: The 2 holds a tremendous amount of power over situations and relationships (love and otherwise) but handles it so carefully that its influence can go almost undetected. It\'s like it\'s working behind the scenes: no one sees it happening, but the results are undeniable. It does not have to push or use force with others because its incredible abilities of compassion and cooperation influence them to follow its guidance.',
'Indecisive: In an effort to always stay in the middle, the number 2 has a hard time seeing biases which makes it difficult to make decisions both large and small. When a preference cannot be identified one way or another, this number gets stuck in inaction.
Easily hurt: The drive to instill harmony within itself and with others is so strong that even the slightest irk or insult can throw the number 2 off balance and into a world of hurt. There are very sensitive energies here. After everything it puts into creating unity, anything that threatens or works against these efforts feels especially painful to the 2.
Unassertive: The number 2 will put its own needs aside in order to keep the peace. More passive than assertive, it may stay in an unpleasant situation far too long, quietly struggling to make it better on its own instead of being more direct and efficient in its actions. It will often choose its current experience over a new and different path.',

(3,'The number 3 is one of nine very important symbols in Numerology: the single-digit numbers. Each of the numbers 1-9 in Numerology has a different meaning -- like its own personality that sets it apart from the others. By understanding the unique personality traits of these numbers, we can better understand their influence and their guiding messages. Whether they show up in a Numerology reading or seem to appear over and over in our lives, it\'s a sign that there\'s opportunity waiting for us. When it comes to the optimistic number 3, communication, connection, and unbridled creativity are the opportunities in store.',
'The 3 has a tendency to thrive in an upbeat and engaging atmosphere. Its energy is youthful and positive and it has an incredible zest for life. It dances from one enjoyable experience to the next, eager to interact with others along the way. The prized skill of the number 3 is communication and it uses this talent to build a wide and interesting circle of friends, lovers, and kindred spirits.
The 3 is highly original and embraces unique thinking and creative expression. This number\'s artistic, curious nature allows it to convey abstract ideas and find solutions others may miss. A child at heart, the number 3 never misses a chance to have fun, engage with others, and express all the love and joy it embodies.',
'Charming, romantic, and full of creative energy, people who were born with a 3 Life Path number know how to embrace life! They tend to see the world through rose-colored lenses where everything looks like an opportunity and the chances for expression and enjoyment are endless. They have a tendency to be skilled communicators and have a knack for coming up with and sharing brilliant ideas. The Life Path 3 makes an excellent journalist, blogger, social media influencer, or author.
People with a Life Path number 3 enjoy an active social life where they can interact with others often. From the moment of birth, their light is warm and exciting and draws many friends and admirers. They tend to be extroverted and embrace any opportunity to show off their original thoughts and stand-out personality. They have a way with words and can charm their way into anyone\'s heart.
But while Life Path 3 people are great at attracting others, forming real, deep bonds is the difficult part. They want to keep things fun and new but feel they have to give that up if they make themselves vulnerable to intimacy. Those with this Life Path live in the moment, so the idea of committing to anything long-term can be a daunting one.
A person with this Life Path number is very fun to be around, but could also benefit from embracing a deeper, more spiritual side of life. While those with a 3 Life Path truly enjoy who they are and what they do, there\'s a more meaningful level of experience and emotion that people with this Life Path may never even know exists. It\'s an untapped well of ideas to explore and engage with if they will muster up the courage to go to a deeper, more spiritual level.
Though people born with a Life Path number 3 will be dealt both joy and hardship just like the rest of us, their unique way of thinking and dedication to happiness allow them to always see the silver lining. The power of positivity goes a long way for people with this Life Path.',
'Communicative: The 3 is a communicator through and through and shines in all forms of expression. It is bursting with thoughts, ideas, dreams, and musings and must let them out to the world. The number 3 is the ""ideas person,"" and by sharing these notions it attracts supportive energies that can turn its ideas into real plans.
Artistic: Color, music, creation ... anything that engages the senses has the number 3 written all over it. It realizes the written and spoken word can only take us so far. Words can communicate ideas, but to express our feelings we need the unparalleled power of art.
Charming: The number 3 has an easy time attracting other people with its magnetic personality. Its lighthearted demeanor and ability to communicate well combine to create a natural charisma that gets and keeps others\' attention. Without even trying, the 3 in Numerology is the apple of everyone.\'s eye.',
'Naive: The young and innocent nature of the number 3 in Numerology makes it very unaware of the realities of the world. Because it hasn\'t had any experience to develop this mature wisdom, it is susceptible to making poor decisions, putting itself in bad situations, and getting burned by others.
Unfocused: This number suffers from shiny-object syndrome. It is excited by everything it sees and won\'t spend much time looking in one direction before shifting focus elsewhere. It is so full of enthusiastic energy that it just wants to live and love and laugh and create ... which means real-life goals and progress fall by the wayside.
Shallow: The 3 in Numerology prefers to live on the surface of life and relationships. To go deeper would mean opening itself to potential negativity and having to relate to feelings and situations that it doesn\'t have much experience with. This number puts pleasure before growth -- if it isn\'t lighthearted and enjoyable, the 3 would rather not participate at all.',

(4,'The very foundation of the science of Numerology is the nine single-digit numbers. Each number represents a different meaning and a unique energy that influences who we are and what happens in our lives. Number symbols are everywhere around us and seeing them often can mean a valuable message from the universe is trying to get through. Even a person\'s Numerology chart is made up almost entirely of the numbers 1-9, so it\'s important that we understand how the traits of each number affects and guides us. With the number 4 in the picture, practicality, hard work, discipline, and responsibility come in spades.',
'When strength and efficiency are needed, it\'s number 4 to the rescue. The 4 in Numerology is a no-nonsense number with a heads-down approach to life and work. It is extremely dependable and lends a great amount of stability to a person or situation. The 4 is dedicated to advancing, but in a more conservative way than a progressive one. It sticks to what is tried-and-true instead of attempting methods that are new.
Even more than the number 13 in western cultures, the number 4 is considered very unlucky in some Asian countries. There\'s even a name for the fear of the number 4: tetraphobia. But in reality the Numerology number 4 carries a wise and rational energy that can bring us a sense of security and consistency. It has a strict definition of right and wrong and tends to see things as black and white with no grey in between. The number 4 leads with its head, not its heart, and uses this mental strength to build a life of service and contentment.',
'Dedicated, patient, down to earth, and hard-working, people with a 4 Life Path number are a great source of stability in our world. They aren\'t interested in rocking the boat because they know that constant, steady effort is the surest path to their goals. Life Path 4 people are consistent in their methods and their moods and they keep themselves composed. They experience a range of emotions just like everyone else, but their practical way of processing their feelings keeps them from going to extremes.
With a wide range of knowledge, Life Path number 4 people are natural teachers. They are confident in what they know and speak with such clarity and authority that others accept what they say. They need to remember, though, that they are also students and that there is always, always more to learn. Life Path 4 people tend to make firm decisions about what is ""right"" and close the door on anything new or different. Stuck with outdated methods and old information, these people may come up short of their true potential.
In relationships, people with a 4 Life Path are honest, loyal, and committed, and they need the same from a partner. Trust and fidelity are vital to them and its important they find someone who shares their religious perspectives and values. 4 people will not waste their time with someone they\'re not compatible with, but when they find that special someone, they work hard to make the relationship successful and are in it for the long haul. Though a relationship with a Life Path number 4 person won\'t be the most exciting one, it is sure to be stable and prosperous.',
'Practical: The 4 has a realistic outlook on life and isn\'t swayed by the newest or shiniest object, experience, or idea. This rationality allows it to make wise decisions and develop solid plans that can really move the meter. For the 4, practicality is the root of productivity.
Loyal: The number 4 prides itself on being dependable and will work hard all day to prove its level of commitment. It needs a stable foundation to feel comfortable, so it will put great effort into creating secure, long-lasting relationships, opportunities, and agreements.
Service-oriented: Its hardworking nature means that service comes naturally to the 4. It knows you need to put in time and effort to get the best results, so acts of service in relationships, jobs, friendships, and at home are necessary to keep things running smoothly. It\'s another way the 4 creates stability, and it is happy to put in the work.',
'Dogmatic: The nature of the number 4 is very conservative and firm in its personal beliefs. Once it has made up its mind it sees its opinions as facts and has no hang-ups about preaching them to others. Unfortunately, this concrete way of thinking leaves no room for other perspectives to enter. While the 4 believes it is staying true to itself, it really is limiting itself.
Dull: Choosing to work over play and sticking to traditional interests and activities, the number 4 can honestly be a bit boring. It can be a straight-edge that is not easily excited nor is it interested in experimenting or trying new things. It is perfectly content in its way of life, it\'s just that this way of life isn\'t all that interesting to others.
Rigid: It\'s hard for the number 4 to be a team player because it is so inflexible. It\'s confident to a fault, always thinking it\'s right and never allowing itself to be swayed. This assuredness makes sense in some situations, but when it comes to give-and-take and working together, the 4 has a lot to learn.',

(5,'Every one of the numbers in Numerology has its very own set of personality traits that sets it apart from the other numbers. The traits the numbers represent help us understand the meaning of these important symbols and the unique ways they impact our lives. The foundation of Numerology are the meanings of the single-digit numbers, and the number 5 in Numerology holds a special place in this mix. In the span of single-digit numbers 1-9, 5 is the number in the exact middle. It acts as a go-between and a pivotal point of change.',
'A key characteristic of the number 5 is curiosity and the need for a variety of exciting experiences in order to feel fulfilled. It craves freedom and adventure and isn\'t afraid to let the wind carry it where it may. For the 5, life isn\'t about setting goals and making plans, it\'s about getting out there and experimenting. Anything that stirs the senses piques the 5\'s interest and it can\'t wait to partake in the experience.
The Numerology number 5 is a master of change, able to go with the flow and adapt itself to thrive in different environments and social situations. It is happiest when things feel fresh, high energy, and full of possibility. The moment an experience starts to feel too routine or predictable, the 5 will move on to something more captivating. The only thing this number is truly attached to is being unattached.',
'People with a 5 Life Path number are on a lifelong adventure. They are ready for anything and want to soak up every experience this world has to offer. Life Path number 5 people tend to learn by living and don\'t allow themselves to get stuck in any situation that has outworn its interest. The moment things start to get humdrum, a person with this Life Path will move on to something more fascinating.
Routine is unbearable to people with a Life Path 5, so typical 9-5 jobs are not appealing to them. Though they will change their career path many times throughout life, positions that allow them the freedom to make their own decisions will be the most satisfying. And whether on the job or off, making time for travel will be key to feeling fulfilled for those with this Life Path.
Meeting new people is no problem for a person with this Life Path number -- they are very social creatures by nature and enjoy engaging with others. What is more difficult for these people is maintaining friendships and romantic relationships beyond the initial stages. They have a tendency to lose interest and bow out before there\'s a chance to make a deeper connection. When they are in a relationship, people with a Life Path number 5 make exciting partners who want to show and share everything with their companion. However, their fickle and flighty nature makes it tough to ever really get close.
If there\'s one thing a Life Path 5 person\'s life will never be, it\'s boring. To them, life is about experimenting and engaging and learning and enjoying and they can\'t wait to take it all in each and every day. Anyone with the 5 Life Path doesn\'t always know exactly where they\'re going, but they\'re guaranteed an epic journey.',
'Curious: The opposite of tunnel vision, the Numerology number 5 has 360-degree vision and everything it sees looks enticing. This curious nature leads it into a variety of exciting and enlightening new experiences few others may have. For the 5, the best way to learn is to experiment.
Adaptable: This number does not stick with any one idea, job, relationship, or situation long, so being flexible is vital. Its detached emotions allow it more freedom of movement. Whether something changes by choice or by chance, this number can easily shift gears and direct its attention and energy toward its new circumstances.
Social: The number 5 is an explorer and knows that one of the best ways to experience the world is to interact with the people in it. Whether it\'s one-on-one or in a lively group setting, this number flourishes in social situations and never misses a chance to engage with and learn from someone new.',
'Non-committal: An uncontrollable need for freedom and constant change makes the number 5 very non-committal. To the 5, committing means being bored and tied down, which goes against everything it stands for. Forming meaningful relationships and becoming proficient in life skills are difficult because this number lacks the attention to see things through.
Unreliable: Easily distracted and sometimes curious to a fault, the number 5 has difficulty maintaining its focus long enough to follow through on projects and promises. This inconsistency is damaging to agreements and relationships of all types and can make the 5 come across as incapable and uncaring.
Directionless: This number has no problem just seeing where life takes it. But without any sense of direction, the 5 wastes a lot of time on experiences that don\'t serve a purpose while missing out on opportunities that could make it more successful. Looking back, the 5 may realize it should have spent more time preparing.',

Whether these numbers are part of your birth date, come up in your Numerology reading, or you simply see the same numbers everywhere you look, understanding the meaning of each number helps you understand their impact on your life. With the beautiful number 6, it\'s all about love.',
'The number 6 is the embodiment of the heart. It represents unconditional love and the ability to support, nurture, and heal. It is a powerful force of compassion and empathy and its warm light is a beacon of hope. Its role is to use its heart and soul to be of service to others.
The 6 in Numerology shines in partnerships of all kinds but especially emotional ones. Its empathy makes others comfortable letting down their guard and being open and honest about their feelings which, in turn, allows it to understand and provide the help that\'s needed. We could all use someone in our life who manifests the devoted energy of the 6.',
'People born with a Life Path 6 embrace their emotions and lead with their heart. They give off a warm and inviting energy that others want to be around. They enjoy many rich relationships throughout their life, both romantic and friendly. Whether these Life Path people encounter someone who is just like them or someone who is entirely different, they will treat them the same: with kindness, respect, and support. Some Life Path numbers only see black and white, but the Life Path number 6 can see and accept the infinite shades of grey between.
With a natural ability to connect with others and offer aid and advice, 6 people do well as professional counselors, mentors, and teachers. These people are also natural humanitarians, eager to speak up, raise funds, and offer emotional support and protection for those that need it. This Life Path truly embraces the meaning of ""A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle."" They have an infinite well of love to give, and they know the world could use it.
The love life of a person born with a 6 Life Path number is deep and romantic. They are refreshing to partners who may be used to lovers who don\'t relate as well to their feelings. Though not every relationship can be a lifelong one, 6 Life Path people are devoted to love and harmony and committed to making things last. What these people need to remember, however, is that they are also individuals. It may be noble to sacrifice oneself to love, but it\'s not healthy. People with a Life Path number 6 must remember to direct the same attention they give others onto themselves. Only then will they feel truly, universally balanced.',
'Supportive: When a shoulder is needed to lean on, the number 6 will be the first to arrive, equipped with a kind, soft presence and heartfelt advice. It does not simply wait to speak -- it truly listens and seeks to understand so it can direct its compassion and healing where it is needed most.
Protective: The unconditional love of the 6 extends to all beings and allows it to speak up for those that don\'t have a voice. But this protection becomes especially fierce when it comes to family. Anything that threatens to upset the emotional or spiritual balance of its loved ones will awaken the ire of the 6.
Romantic: The 6 is more romantic than any other number. It works hard to create peaceful, mutual relationships and is fluent in all the love languages. The number 6 is only happy when its other half is happy, so it will direct all its time, support, and affection into making this so.',
'Passive: In an effort to please others and keep the peace, the number 6 may allow itself to get taken advantage of often. More assertive, controlling energies can easily overpower the 6 who would rather go along with an undesirable option than speak up and make waves.
Self-sacrificing: While its compassion is a virtue, the number 6 is so willing to sacrifice itself for other people and the sake of harmony that it neglects its own needs and well-being. There is only so much one can give and this number often overlooks the self-care that would make it feel balanced. As they say, you can\'t pour from an empty cup.
Idealistic: The 6 expects everyone to treat others the way it does which, in its mind, would lead to a perfect world. But that\'s not the way the real world works, and when this number realizes its ideals are unattainable it may face extreme upset and imbalance.',

(7,'We meet a vast array of different energies as we get to know the meanings of the single-digit numbers in Numerology. Each of these nine Numerology numbers represent a unique set of traits that affect the vibrations around us in their own way. These numbers impact us on an internal and external level every day so it\'s important we understand the effects they have. When the number 7 is involved, we are taken on a great quest for answers and truth.',
'The number 7 is both deep and wise. It is not satisfied with simple explanations and surface-level information -- this is frivolous stuff. It knows that the real gold is buried deeper and won\'t stop until it finds it ... and then it\'ll keep digging for more. Asking questions, researching, listening, and sensing are all special skills the 7 uses in its search for awareness.
Though spirituality is especially important to the number 7 in Numerology, it takes a more intellectual approach to life than an emotional one. It is an analytical number that enjoys gathering and filtering through information to find answers. Still, it has a more powerful intuition than you might expect which it uses as a guide. This combination of conscious and subconscious thinking allows the mind of the Numerology number 7 to shine a light into the very deepest realms to access hidden truths.',
'People born with a Life Path 7 are eternal students of the universe. They are introspective individuals with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and they enjoy looking into the inner workings of things. Someone with this Life Path is a true thinker who lets their mind lead the way. Pretty much from the moment of birth, they are able to skillfully combine the exacting side of their brain with their divine intuitive side to learn about, process, and make sense of life itself.
The 7 Life Path in Numerology is smart in a knowledgeable way, yet wise in a spiritual way. People with this Life Path number enjoy gaining book smarts, but they are also more connected to their higher self than most and have great access to this inner wisdom. While they are spiritual creatures, though, Life Path 7 people don\'t tend to be the religious type. Strict doctrines that don\'t make room for new information are a turn-off to these inquisitive folk.
Similar to The Hermit in a Tarot deck, people born with a Life Path number 7 often go it alone. They like the freedom of not having to explain themselves and enjoy the control and possibility of solitude. Their social circle tends to be a small one made up of people with like-minded interests. They may come across to the world as a bit awkward in groups or when meeting new people. Romantically, people with this Life Path may find it hard to connect on an emotional level with others. They love the part of getting to know someone, asking questions and exchanging answers, but often lack the interest or ability to build a heartfelt bond.
Professions that require research and problem-solving skills are a perfect fit for those with a Life Path 7. If given a quiet space to think and work, they\'ll dive deeper than anyone into a problem and come out with the most valuable and viable solution. Their analytical powers are off the charts and these skills make them an asset to any project or team.',
'Spiritual: The 7\'s understanding that there is always something deeper, something more we can\'t see, instills in it a great sense of spirituality. While religion is too limiting for this boundless number, a very personal, intellectual connection to the spiritual world gives its experiences more mystery and meaning.
Curious: With infinite questions waiting to be answered, the world is an incredibly engaging place for the number 7. It finds interest in many topics and seeks to absorb as much knowledge and understanding as it can. Whether it\'s practical or metaphysical doesn\'t matter, the number 7 always wants to know more.
Analytical: The number 7 isn\'t just an information sponge. While it is driven to take in all the data it can, its real strength lies in sorting through what it finds. Being able to separate what\'s useful from what\'s meaningless and identify fact from fiction helps the 7 stay on track and follow the most valuable wisdom.',
'Reclusive: The 7 spends most of its time deep in thought and study and doesn\'t place much importance on the lighter side of life. Over time a lack of social involvement turns the 7 even further inward, limiting its life experiences and making it unable to forge new friendships and romantic connections.
Secretive: This number is more comfortable holding its cards close to its chest. It\'s not that the 7 is trying to hide damaging secrets, it just doesn\'t feel the need for everyone to know everything about it. The problem is, it\'s impossible to connect with others in genuine way if you won\'t ever let them see to the real you.
Suspicious: Because of its insatiable need to look below the surface, the number 7 may upset a good thing by making assumptions and accusations or digging for answers when there are none. It is always assuming there is more to the story, even when there really isn\'t.',

(8,'Every number in Numerology has a different meaning. The real substance is in the single digits; each of these numeric symbols casts a unique energy that impacts us on both external and internal levels -- and even how it relates to our compatibility with other people! By understanding the different meanings of these numbers in Numerology, we can better realize the messages the numbers are sending when they appear in our lives. If there is an abundance of the number 8 in your life, the meaning of these messages center around hard work, success, and karmic balance.',
'Of all the numbers in Numerology, the number 8 is the achiever and measures life by the goals it reaches. It has good business sense, a powerful presence, and a strong drive for success. The 8 is also a symbol of balance -- you can see it in its symmetrical shape. For every blessing it receives, it puts one back out to the universe. When things are balanced, they feel stable, controlled, and supported, which is the most productive environment for the 8 to work in.
In Chinese culture, the number 8 is considered the luckiest number of all, and is purposefully worked into wedding dates, birth dates, addresses, and finances. Even in the world of Numerology, there are people who have been known to change their name in order to add more 8s to their Numerology chart, hoping to emulate this number\'s level of accomplishment. The 8 represents an ultimate form of achievement that many will spend their entire lives striving for.',
'The Life Path number 8 personality is one of hard work and hard lessons. People born with this Life Path number get their worth from accomplishing great things -- the bigger the goal, the more satisfying it feels when they achieve it. Money and material goods are important to them because they are rewards and reminders of all the effort put in. People with this Life Path direct all their energy into creating a life of success and abundance.
Dealing with people in positions of authority is often tough for people born with an 8 Life Path number. Because they are leaders themselves and are supremely confident in their abilities, they don\'t take kindly to being told what to do -- especially if it goes against what they would choose to do. Life Path 8 people, too, can also come across as authoritative and must learn that all relationships are about harmony.
With all the work these Life path people put into reaching their goals and feeling accomplished, they would be wise to pay attention to their health. Stress is the all-too-familiar enemy of those born with the 8 Life Path number and, if allowed, it will slow down or deter these people on their path to reaching their goals. Making time for meditation, friendship, and enjoyable pursuits helps to bring things back into balance. Health is wealth, so maintaining a healthy lifestyle should be a top priority.
When it comes to relationships, people with an 8 Life Path will put in the same work and dedication that they put into everything else. They do well in long-term situations, but these relationships may look more like business arrangements than passionate love affairs. Life Path number 8 people see themselves as providers and willingly take on the role of supporting a partner or family. They know they are self-sufficient, but when they see that they are prosperous enough to also provide for loved ones, to them, that\'s proof of success.',
'Ambitious: To say the 8 has ambition would be putting it lightly -- they live to achieve! This number is on a mission to reach as many goals and garner as much success as possible. It is strategic in its methods and dedicated to its purpose. The good feelings that come from accomplishment give the 8 everything it needs to keep climbing upward.
Karmic: In a spiritual sense, the number 8 is all about giving back. It realizes that its successes are not its alone and will intentionally recognize and appreciate any help it has received. It balances achievement with gratitude, which can then be rebalanced with more achievement -- it\'s a cycle of success that the 8 is continuously manifesting.
Enduring: Even when the chips are down, the 8 in Numerology has a great sense of fortitude. It knows it is capable, but that capability often isn\'t the only factor at play. With patience and determination, the 8 is confident that things will come around eventually. It is willing to go through struggle because it has no doubt that prosperity is on the other side.',
'Materialistic: The 8 likes to revel in its accomplishments by surrounding itself with nice things. It looks at this as a personal reward and a way to rebalance the cycle of manifestation. Unfortunately, to others this trait can make the 8 appear shallow or like a show-off. It may also attract opportunists who misunderstand the 8\'s intentions.
Authoritative: It\'s no surprise all this accomplishment goes straight to the number 8\'s head. It\'s used to being a leader and this gives it a feeling of personal power. But the 8 always assumes its way is the right way and, by dismissing others\' opinions and ignoring their efforts, it may lose their support even faster than it gained it.
Entitled: The 8 in Numerology isn\'t about to ask for permission or forgiveness. Its need to succeed can make it blind to rules and processes, but ignoring these limits and taking things into its own hands makes teamwork impossible and drives a wedge in partnerships. The number 8 is so used to getting its way that it now expects it.',

(9,'The numbers 1-9 are very important to the science of Numerology. The energy and meaning of each of these numbers is different, so whether we see them in our Numerology charts or wonder why they keep reappearing in our lives, it\'s important to know what they mean so we can understand the messages they are sending us. The number 9, the very last of these numbers, has been on a long journey, and now shines its light of love and divine wisdom into the world.',
'The energy of the number 9 represents completion, but not finality. Think of it more in a cyclical sense; it\'s about the ending of one cycle and the potential it creates for another cycle to begin. The 9 in Numerology acts as an usher in this process of transition or transformation, guiding and empowering us with its wisdom. It absorbs answers from a spiritual source, then delivers them to us in the real world.
This number is a humanitarian at heart. It is compassionate, kind, and intent on putting its efforts toward creating the greatest good. The 9 in Numerology has gone through its fair share of hardship and is wiser, stronger, and more aware as a result. These first-hand experiences make it especially understanding of others who are struggling and willing to provide valuable support.',
'There\'s a special kind of magic that follows people born with a 9 Life Path number. They embody the wisdom of a sage, but not by chance -- they have fought their way through many challenges to reach this point and have gained immeasurable strength and awareness along the way. Life Path number 9 people will often find themselves in a position of providing support and advice and this feels natural to them. The knowledge they have gained can be incredibly valuable to others on their own journeys.
A person who is born with a Life Path 9 tends to be spiritual and connects deeply with religion. Whether it stems from a need for strength during times of struggle or a natural desire to relate to something greater than themselves, Life Path number 9 people often seek courage and meaning from a higher source. Intuitions and gut reactions may even outweigh logic. This connection to the divine gives these people a safety net of confidence as they continue to make their way through life\'s good times and bad.
People with a Life Path 9 may feel a great devotion to their fellow man. They are humanitarians by nature and use their big hearts to support those who have been made to feel inequal or unworthy. But because 9 Life Path people have become so accustomed to enduring their own challenges, others may not notice when they are in need and, unfortunately, they have a very difficult time asking for help. People with this Life Path number must realize that assistance is part of a cycle of give and take, and with as much support as they give, it\'s their karmic responsibility to receive support in return.',
'Awakening: Through life experience, the number 9 in Numerology has learned the value and magnitude of its inner wisdom. It is now in a position to awaken others to their own higher self. Leading by example, the 9 shows how to handle hardship with grace and understanding, inspiring others to do the same.
Tolerant: While some other numbers are strictly focused on black and white, the number 9 sees the infinite shades of grey between. It does not draw a line between any races, religions, or ways of life -- it gives space and respect to everybody. A healthy lack of judgement and bias allows the 9 to see everyone as valuable and worthy of its support.
Supportive: The soft heart of the number 9 attracts many souls looking for support. Regardless of what it is going through itself, it knows its duty is to help others on their way. It is aware of how the world works and knows what it takes to get through challenging times, making it a valuable source of advice, comfort, and healing for others.',
'Resentful: The number 9 has had many experiences that have left a heavy imprint on its heart. When it doesn\'t allow itself to process and heal these wounds, this resentment casts a shadow on the 9\'s spirit and negatively impacts its present-day relationships.
Sacrificing: This number is giving to a fault. It feels it is fulfilling a responsibility by being there in any capacity for those who need it, but this is a sacrificial mindset. The 9 in Numerology is so focused on caring for others that it neglects to care for itself, building the foundation for an imbalanced and unfocused life.
Suffering: Throughout the challenges the number 9 has endured, it can fall into the mindset that life is suffering. It may put more importance on times of struggle than times of ease, or on tumultuous relationships than balanced ones. The more that 9 accepts hardship, the more regular it may become.',
